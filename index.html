            <h1>Hey, Jenny</h1>
            <p>This is something I wanted to share with you.</p>
            <p>There's no obligation for you to do anything. I just think you're important enough to at least understand
                whatâ€™s on my mind.</p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Four years ago, we met, and I really liked you. You accepted me, and we had something special...</p>


            <section class="fade-in">
                <h2>What Happened</h2>
                <p>Life took us in different directions. I had to move, and my health made it hard to travel.</p>
                <p>I have to admit that I wasn't able to accomplish the goal of bringing you to Dom. Maybe I failed
                    because I didn't fully embrace the present moment, and if I had, it could have been something truly
                    special.</p>
                <p>I was, and still am, stuck in a cycle of disbelief about my life situation, and I let that affect our
                    relationship. I know I could have done better.</p>

            <h2>How I Feel Now</h2>
            <p>Seeing you again reminded me of how much I still care. I donâ€™t know what this means for us, but I wanted
                you to know.</p>
            <p>Iâ€™m going to be completely honest with you. I was so determined to achieve great things in life, and
                ending up like this has really broken me. Itâ€™s affected my self-esteem and shattered the big hopes I had
                for the future. I may act strong and smile, but this is me being fully open with you. Getting to know
                you made me realize just how incredibly special you are, and thatâ€™s created uncertainty about our
                future. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m not enough for you because, honestly, I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m enough for myself.
                Maybe if some miracle happens and I recover, Iâ€™d be more comfortable, but I want you to know that Iâ€™ve
                always been skeptical about marriage and kidsðŸ˜‚. But after getting to know you, Iâ€™d be willing to change
                my perspective because youâ€™re that amazing.

                I donâ€™t know what you think about all of this. Maybe youâ€™ve moved on, and I wouldnâ€™t blame you for that.
                The life I imagined hasnâ€™t happened, and it is what it is. </p>
            <p>But despite all the struggles Iâ€™ve faced, Iâ€™m
                really grateful to have known you. Youâ€™ve inspired me in so many waysâ€”Iâ€™ve done things because of you.
                Just thinking of you has motivated me to learn, work, and push forward. I could go on all day talking
                about you, but just know that youâ€™re the best thing that ever happened to me. I swear, Iâ€™ll always
                cherish the wonderful moments we shared.</p>
            <p>In physics, we believe in the concept of a multiverse, where everything that can happen is happening. Understanding this brings me comfort, knowing that somewhere out there, we're together, and everything is perfect, just as weâ€™ve always dreamed.

</p>
            <p>I am sorry for letting you down, Love you. â™¥</p>
